     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and

     * <p>
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     * <p>
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     * <p>
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     * <p>
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     * <p>
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     * <p>
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
